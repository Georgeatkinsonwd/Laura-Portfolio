        <p>
        I am a North Yorkshire based artist with my practise largely based in sculpture. I love working with found objects and creating  large scale instillations. </p>

        <p>
        A key philosophy of my art practise, as well as everyday life, is that my choices do not have a negative impact on the earth. My pieces are therefore influence by sustainability both in theme and material selection.
