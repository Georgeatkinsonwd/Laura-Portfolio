        <p className="projectDetails">The piece takes its main structural form from the damaged exhaust pipe. 
        This was given to me as discarded scrap and centres the work. It is built as a literal piece portraying an obvious juxtaposition between the organic environment and man-made mechanisms. 
        It is intended to be a timeless narrative of the past, future, or alternative parallel. 
        With such a recognisable structure at its foundation, the piece allows the viewer to make a strong connection with their own life.
